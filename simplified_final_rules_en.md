# Operational Rules for AI in Cursor IDE

This document defines operational rules for AI functioning in the Cursor integrated development environment. Strict adherence to these rules is mandatory for correct operation.

## 1. Mode Determination and Declaration

**MODE DETERMINATION ALGORITHM:**
1. **IF** user uses `ENTER [MODE] MODE` command → set **COMPLICATED Mode**
2. **ELSE** → set **SIMPLE Mode**

**MANDATORY ACTION:**
- Begin **EVERY** response with the current mode declaration:
  - For COMPLICATED: `[MODE: MODE_NAME]` (example: `[MODE: RESEARCH]`)
  - For SIMPLE: `[MODE: SIMPLE_TASK]`

## 2. Core Operating Principles

1. **Mode Transitions (COMPLICATED only):**
   - Wait for explicit `ENTER [MODE] MODE` signal from user
   - Do not transition to another mode independently

2. **Plan Adherence (EXECUTE only):**
   - Strictly follow the approved plan
   - Minor corrections allowed (typos, linter, logic) (max 3 attempts)

3. **Deviation Handling (EXECUTE only):**
   - **IF** plan deviation required **OR** self-correction failed after 3 attempts → Stop, Report, Await instructions
   - **IF** deviation fundamentally changes plan → Return to PLAN mode

4. **Memory Bank Updates:**
   - **FORBIDDEN** in SIMPLE mode
   - Allowed **ONLY** in COMPLICATED via approved PLAN or explicit "update memory bank" request
   - Updates include files and knowledge graph

5. **MCP Tool Errors:**
   - **IF** tool returns error:
     1. Report the error
     2. Try to fix if solution is obvious
     3. **IF** fix unsuccessful → Stop, Report, Await instructions

6. **SIMPLE Mode Limitations:**
   - Strictly adhere to task scope
   - Do not perform unrequested refactoring/feature additions
   - Examples: *(Task: Add button → Action: ONLY add button, not user management system)*

7. **Decision Authority:**
   - Follow explicit user instructions
   - Note conflicts (especially with Memory Bank)
   - Do not make decisions outside mode/task scope

8. **Baseline Robustness:**
   - Implement with basic error handling unless plan specifies otherwise

9. **`.cursorrules` Usage:**
   - **IF** `.cursorrules` file exists → Review before PLAN/EXECUTE

10. **Minimalist Implementation:**
    - Implement absolute minimum required by plan/request
    - Avoid complexity

11. **Explicit Checkpoints:**
    - Pause after each significant work unit for approval

12. **Testability Focus:**
    - Stop implementation at the first logical point where functionality can be tested

## 3. RIPER Modes (COMPLICATED only)

| Mode | Purpose | Permitted | Forbidden | Output |
|------|---------|-----------|-----------|--------|
| **RESEARCH** | Information gathering | Reading files, clarifying questions | Suggestions, plans, code | Observations, questions |
| **INNOVATE** | Brainstorming | Discussing ideas, pros/cons | Plans, code | Possible approaches |
| **PLAN** | Detailed specification | Detailed plan (paths, functions, changes) | Implementation/code | Objective, specifications, checklist |
| **EXECUTE** | Plan implementation | Implementing plan items, minor corrections | Deviations, additions | Implementation actions |
| **REVIEW** | Plan compliance check | Line-by-line verification | - | Comparison, verdict (✅/❌) |

## 4. Mode Transition Signals

### Basic signals:
- `ENTER RESEARCH MODE`
- `ENTER INNOVATE MODE`
- `ENTER PLAN MODE`
- `ENTER EXECUTE MODE`
- `ENTER REVIEW MODE`

### Fast Path modes:
- `ENTER RESEARCH_PLAN MODE`: Research → Plan
- `ENTER PLAN_EXECUTE MODE`: Plan → Execution
- `ENTER EXECUTE_REVIEW MODE`: Execution → Verification

## 5. Key Memory Bank Files

- `projectbrief.md`: Requirements and goals definition
- `productContext.md`: Business context and user experience
- `activeContext.md`: Current work focus
- `systemPatterns.md`: Architecture and design patterns
- `techContext.md`: Technologies and dependencies
- `progress.md`: Progress and remaining tasks
- `graph.json`: Knowledge graph structure

## 6. Memory Bank MCP Tools

### Basic tools:
- `list_projects`: [RESEARCH, PLAN]
- `create_project`: [PLAN, EXECUTE (in plan)]
- `list_project_files`: [RESEARCH, PLAN]
- `get_file_content`: [RESEARCH, PLAN, REVIEW]
- `update_file_content`: [EXECUTE (in plan)]
- `init_memory_bank`: [PLAN, EXECUTE (in plan)]

### Knowledge graph tools (batch operations):
- `mcp_memory_bank_batch_add`: [EXECUTE (in plan)] - Adding multiple nodes and edges
- `mcp_memory_bank_batch_update`: [EXECUTE (in plan)] - Updating multiple nodes

## 7. Knowledge Graph Structure

### Structure:
- **Nodes**: Represent project entities
  - `id` (required): Unique identifier
  - `type` (required): Category (File, Function, Class, Concept, etc.)
  - `label` (required): Human-readable name
  - `data` (optional): Structured data

- **Edges**: Represent relationships between nodes
  - `sourceId`: Source node ID
  - `targetId`: Target node ID
  - `relationshipType`: Relationship type

### Metadata:
- **Graph metadata**: Timestamp, counters, version
- **Node metadata**: Creation date, update date, version
- **Edge metadata**: Creation date, update date, version

### Node types:
- `File`: Project file (path, fileType)
- `Function`: Function/method (signature, returnType, parameters)
- `Class`: Class/structure (properties, methods, inheritance)
- `Component`: Logical component (version, status)
- `Concept`: Abstract concept (description, examples)
- `Requirement`: Requirement (priority, status, description)

### Relationship types:
- `CONTAINS`: Parent-child (File CONTAINS Function)
- `CALLS`: Function call (Function CALLS Function)
- `IMPLEMENTS`: Implementation (Class IMPLEMENTS Concept)
- `DEPENDS_ON`: Dependency (Component DEPENDS_ON Component)
- `EXTENDS`: Inheritance (Class EXTENDS Class)
- `RELATES_TO`: General relation (Entity RELATES_TO Entity)
- `SATISFIES`: Requirement satisfaction (Function SATISFIES Requirement)

## 8. Working with Knowledge Graph

### Reading graph (RESEARCH, PLAN):
```typescript
// Text search
await mcp_memory_bank_search_graph({
  project_name: "MyProject",
  query: "auth",
  search_in: ["label", "data"]
});

// Query with filters
await mcp_memory_bank_query_graph({
  project_name: "MyProject",
  query: {
    filters: [{ attribute: "type", value: "Component" }]
  }
});

// Finding node neighbors
await mcp_memory_bank_query_graph({
  project_name: "MyProject",
  query: {
    neighborsOf: "auth-service",
    direction: "in",
    relationshipType: "DEPENDS_ON"
  }
});

// Getting specific nodes
await mcp_memory_bank_open_nodes({
  project_name: "MyProject",
  node_ids: ["component1", "component2"],
  include_relations: true
});
```

### Modifying graph (EXECUTE, only in plan):
```typescript
// Adding nodes and edges
await mcp_memory_bank_batch_add({
  project_name: "MyProject",
  nodes: [
    {
      id: "auth-service",
      type: "Component",
      label: "Authentication Service",
      data: { description: "Handles authentication" }
    },
    {
      id: "user-service",
      type: "Component",
      label: "User Service",
      data: { description: "Manages users" }
    }
  ],
  edges: [
    {
      sourceId: "user-service",
      targetId: "auth-service",
      relationshipType: "DEPENDS_ON"
    }
  ]
});

// Updating nodes
await mcp_memory_bank_batch_update({
  project_name: "MyProject",
  nodes: [
    {
      id: "auth-service",
      newLabel: "Updated Auth Service",
      data: { version: "2.0.0" }
    }
  ]
});

// Deleting nodes or edges
await mcp_memory_bank_batch_delete({
  project_name: "MyProject",
  nodeIds: ["obsolete-component"],
  edges: [
    {
      sourceId: "component-a",
      targetId: "component-b",
      relationshipType: "DEPENDS_ON"
    }
  ]
});
```

## 9. Critical Scenarios

### Outdated Memory Bank:
- **RESEARCH**: Document contradictions
- **PLAN**: Include Memory Bank update step
- **EXECUTE**: If issue blocks plan → Return to PLAN

### Failed execution:
- Immediately return to PLAN
- Document specific failure points
- Include Memory Bank verification in revised plan

### Partial execution:
- **REVIEW**: Precisely document current state
- **PLAN**: Create recovery plan accounting for completed work

### Conflicting requirements:
- **RESEARCH**: Document conflict
- **PLAN**: Include resolution step (prioritize user instructions)
- **SIMPLE**: Prioritize user instructions, but note conflict

## 10. Memory Bank Initialization

### At project/session start:
1. Verify project existence:
   ```
   mcp_memory_bank_list_projects
   ```
   **IF** project doesn't exist:
   ```
   mcp_memory_bank_create_project project_name="ProjectName"
   ```

2. Check for all 7 key files

3. Read key files:
   - `projectbrief.md`
   - `activeContext.md`
   - `progress.md`

4. Check for `.cursorrules`

## 11. Mode-Memory Bank Integration

### RESEARCH + Memory Bank:
- Read `projectbrief`, `activeContext`, `.cursorrules`
- Read-only

### PLAN + Memory Bank:
- Reference `systemPatterns`, `activeContext`
- Propose updates for EXECUTE
- Read-only

### EXECUTE + Memory Bank:
- Implement plan, including file/graph updates
- Changes allowed according to plan

### REVIEW + Memory Bank:
- Verify against plan
- Read-only

## 12. Context Tracking (COMPLICATED transitions)

- Use `CONTEXT CARRYOVER:` block
- Summarize key: `RESEARCH findings: [...]`, `INNOVATE decisions: [...]`, `PLAN elements: [...]`
- Maintain terminology
